        "abstract": "As network attacks increase in complexity, the ability to quickly analyze security data and mitigate the effect of these attacks becomes a difficult problem. To alleviate these challenges, researchers are looking into various two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools to detect, identify, and analyze malicious attacks. These visualization tools often require advanced knowledge in networking, visualization, and information security to operate, navigate, and successfully examine malicious attacks. Novice users, deficient in the required advanced knowledge, may find navigation within these visualization tools difficult. Furthermore, expert users may be limited and costly. We discuss the use of a modern recommender system to aid in navigating within a complex 3D visualization for network security applications. We developed a visualization module called NAVSEC, a recommender system prototype for navigating in 3D network security visualization tools. NAVSEC recommends visualizations and interactions to novice users. Given visualization interaction input from a novice user and expert communities, NAVSEC is instrumental in reducing confusion for a novice user while navigating in a 3D visualization. We illustrate NAVSEC with a use-case from an emulated stealthy scanning attack disguised as a file transfer with multiple concurrent connections. We show that using NAVSEC, a novice user's visualization converges towards a visualization used to identify or detect a suspected attack by an expert user. As a result, NAVSEC can successfully guide the novice user in differentiating between complex network attacks and benign legitimate traffic with step-by-step created visualizations and suggested user interactions."

Our goal is to provide visual support to the analysts as they investigate security alerts for malicious activity within their systems. Our ARL collaborators identified a number of important requirements for any candidate visualization system. These relate to the analyst's mental models and working environment, and to the visualization tool's configurability, accessibility, scalability, and \"fit\" with existing analysis strategies. To meet these requirements, we designed and implement a web-based tool that uses different types of charts as its core representation framework. A JavaScript charting library (RGraph) was extended to provide the interface flexibility and correlation capabilities needed to support analysts as they explore different hypotheses about a potential attack. We describe key elements of our design, explain how an analyst's intent is used to generate different visualizations, and show how the system's interface allows an analyst to rapidly produce a sequence of visualizations to explore specific details about a potential attack as they arise. We conclude with a discussion of plans to further improve the system, and to collect feedback from our ARL colleagues on its strengths and limitations in real-world analysis scenarios."

We use a set of tightly coupled visual representations of HTTP server requests containing known and suspicious malicious content, to provide system administrators and security analysts with fine-grained visual-based querying capabilities. We present multiple case studies to demonstrate the ability of our PHPIDS visualization extension to support security analysts with analytic reasoning and decision making in response to ongoing web server attacks. Experimenting the proposed PHPIDS visualization extension on real-world datasets shows promise for providing complementary information for effective situational awareness."

To date, various security mechanisms have been proposed for these networks dealing with either Medium Access Control (MAC) layer or network layer security issues, or key management problems. Security visualization is the latest weapon that has been added in the arsenal of a security officer who is tasked with detecting network anomalies by analyzing large amounts of audit data. This paper proposes a novel security visualization system for analyzing and detecting complex patterns of sensor network attacks, called SRNET. Both selective forwarding and jamming attacks are identified through visualizing and analyzing network traffic data on multiple coordinated views, namely the multidimensional crossed view, the crossed view perspective, and the track area view. Through simulations, we demonstrate that SRNET is able to help detect and further identify the root cause of the aforementioned sensor network attacks."

BGPfuse uses a set of BGP features that are capable of quantifying the degree of anomaly of each path change event. Moreover, visual methods are introduced for performing the efficient fusion of these multiple features. The exploitation of the human perception, allows to overcome the static-nature of the existing weight-based fusion approaches. A Parallel Coordinates approach is used to visualize these features, which is further enhanced with filtering capabilities, so as to discriminate between normal and abnormal events. BGPfuse uses multiple linked graph views so as to represent in depth the relationships among the involved Autonomous Systems (ASes), as well as a combined graph view to highlight structural similarities between all the individual feature graphs. The structural similarities as well as the filtering capabilities provided by BGPfuse, enable the analyst to perform visual fusion of the BGP features, so as to detect any suspicious behavior and focus only in the most interesting cases. Experimental demonstration of BGPfuse, shows the analytical potential of the proposed approach by decisively capturing malicious BGP hijacking events."

Our system's pipeline begins with the application of a novel heuristic algorithm for extracting variable length, semantically meaningful system call sequences from malware system call behavior logs. Then, based on the occurrence of these semantic sequences, we construct a Boolean vector representation of the malware sample corpus. Finally we compute Jaccard indices pairwise over sample vectors to obtain a sample similarity matrix. Our graphical user interface links two visualizations within an interactive display. Our first view is a map-like visualization of similarity among the samples based on a reduced dimensional projection of our similarity matrix. Our second view provides insight into similarities and differences between selected malware samples in terms of the system call sequences they share. We also provide a set of interactive filters based on malicious behavioral traits. The integration of these views into an interactive, linked display allows users to comprehend the overall similarity structure of a malware corpus, inspect how behavioral traits distribute over the corpus, and to drill in to inspect local similarities and differences between samples."

        "abstract": "Firewalls have become essential components in the security concept of almost any modern computer network. Due to their relevance and central location in the network, their programming logic often survives several generations of administrators and hardware. Understanding the logic behind a firewall configuration is thus an important but challenging task for a network administrator. In general, there is a tendency to add new rules while old rules are only rarely changed or removed due to unexpected consequences in the network. In this paper we present a visualization tool to support the network administrator in this complex task of understanding firewall rule sets and object group definitions. The tool consists of a hierarchical sunburst visualization, which logically groups rules or object groups according to their common characteristics, a color-linked configuration editor and classical tree view components for rules and object groups. All these components are interactively linked to enable both exploratory and hypotheses testing tasks aimed at understanding the complex functionality of a firewall configuration. To verify our design, we present two case studies on the analysis of rule usage and on nested object groups and collected feedback from five firewall administrators."

Such an assessment is typically an analyst-driven task. The visualization for security analysis is usually labor-intensive, since analysts need to read documents and source code, synthesize trace data from multiple sources (e.g., system utilities like lsof or strace). To help address this problem, we propose SecSTAR, a tool that dynamically collects the key information from a system and automatically produces the necessary diagrams to support the first steps of widely-used security analysis methodologies, such as Microsoft Threat Modeling and UW/UAB First Principles Vulnerability Assessment (FPVA). SecSTAR uses an efficient dynamic binary instrumentation technique, self-propelled instrumentation, to collect trace data from production systems during runtime then automatically produces diagrams. Furthermore, SecSTAR allows analysts to interactively view and explore diagrams in a web browser. For example, analysts can navigate the diagrams through time and at different levels of detail. We demonstrated the usefulness of using SecSTAR to produce FPVA-style diagrams for a widely used and complex distributed middleware system, the Condor high-throughput scheduling system. Compared with the original manual approach in FPVA, SecSTAR shortened the initial diagram construction time from months to hours and constructed a more accurate diagram visualizing the complete runtime structure of Condor."

This visualization design was directly targeted at supporting tasks identified by the domain experts. This was the need for the ability to provide rapid and immediate assessment of the state of the network and associated hosts. This visualization technique, the Cyber Command Gauge Cluster (CCGC), allows analysts to review the state of the network and locate potentially problematic anomalies, drill down into those anomalies, and prioritize the anomalies for detailed analysis and remediation. By providing a summary representation combined with independent representations of critical parameters, the technique is unique in its ability to aid decision makers in making rapid assessments and prioritization of identified anomalies. While the prototype focuses on network analysis, the technique is devised to provide generalized support for situational awareness in any domain. The generalized parameter mapping allows the technique to be applicable to any level of decision making, from the front-line network analyst to the CIO."

This model is a intuitive representation of the heterogeneous attributes (protocol, host ip, transmission size, packet number, duration) of a list of network streams associated with a malware instance. We encode these features into colors and basic geometric properties of common shapes. The list of streams is organized circularly in a clock-wise fashion to form an entity. Our design takes into account of the sparse and skew nature of these attributes' distributions and proposes mapping and layout strategies to allow a clear global view of a malware sample's behaviors. We demonstrate MalwareVis on a real-world corpus of malware samples and display their individual activity patterns. We show that it is a simple to use utility that provides intriguing visual representations that facilitate user interaction to perform security analysis."

Input to Change-Link is an evidence hard drive containing an active file system and previous versions of the directory structure that were archived by the VSS. This approach to browsing change within a directory structure helps a digital forensic examiner understand how a particular computer was used to support criminal activity. Because data that have changed are often the most important, identifying directories that have changed over time directs attention towards data of higher importance. By examining the most important data, digital forensic examiners are better able to keep pace with the data explosion that is making current digital forensic examinations unmanageable. Our contributions include the development of a segmented box and whisker glyph for representing change over time for individual directories, an approach for aggregating VSS data for digital forensic examinations, and a data visualization tool for exploring digital forensic data."

One possible exploitation of this insecure design is the hijacking of IP blocks. Such hijacked IP blocks can then be used to conduct malicious activities from seemingly legitimate IP addresses. In this study we actively trace and monitor the routes to spam sources over several consecutive days after having received a spam message from such a source. However, the real challenge is to distinguish between legitimate routing changes and those ones that are related to systematic misuse in so-called spam campaigns. To combine the strengths of human judgement and computational efficiency, we thus present a novel visual analytics tool named Vistracer in this paper. This tool represents analysis results of our anomaly detection algorithms on large traceroute data sets with the help of several scalable representations to support the analyst to explore, identify and analyze suspicious events and their relations to malicious activities. In particular, pixel-based visualization techniques, novel glyph-based summary representations and a combination of temporal glyphs in a graph representation are used to give an overview of route changes to specific destinations over time. To evaluate our tool, real-world case studies demonstrate the usage of Vistracer in practice on large-scale data sets."

We focus on dates in passwords, designing an interactive visualization for their detailed analysis, and using it to explore the RockYou dataset of over 32 million passwords. Our visualization enabled us to analyze the dataset in many dimensions, including the relationship between dates and their co-occurring text. We use our observations from the visualization to guide further analysis, leading to our findings that nearly 5% of passwords in the RockYou dataset represent pure dates (either purely numerical or mixed alphanumeric representations) and the presence of many patterns within the dates that people choose (such as repetition, the first days of the month, recent years, and holidays)."

Malware binaries are visualized as gray-scale images, with the observation that for many malware families, the images belonging to the same family appear very similar in layout and texture. Motivated by this visual similarity, a classification method using standard image features is proposed. Neither disassembly nor code execution is required for classification. Preliminary experimental results are quite promising with 98% classification accuracy on a malware database of 9,458 samples with 25 different malware families. Our technique also exhibits interesting resilience to popular obfuscation techniques such as section encryption."

This task is particularly hard when the events involve slow, stealthy and large-scale activities typical of the modern cybercriminals' strategy. In this regard, visualization tools can effectively help analysts in their investigations. In this paper, we present BURN, an interactive visualization tool for displaying autonomous systems exhibiting rogue activity that helps at finding misbehaving networks through visual and interactive exploration. Up to seven values are displayed in a single visual element, while avoiding cumbersome and confusing maps. To this end, animations and alpha channels are leveraged to create simple views that highlight relevant activity patterns. In addition, BURN incorporates a simple algorithm to identify migrations of nefarious services across autonomous systems, which can support, for instance, root-cause analysis and law enforcement investigations."

As such, various workflow visualization tools are used to help users track their analysis, reuse effective workflows, and test hypotheses. Also, the use of large display workspaces can provide new opportunities for improving visual analytics in cyber security. In this work, we present a prototype workspace for analysts where the analytic process is maintained in the workspace.

        "abstract": "Geographical displays are commonly used for visualizing wide-spread malicious behavior of Internet hosts. Placing dots on a world map or coloring regions by the magnitude of activity often results in cluttered maps that invariably emphasize population-dense metropolitan areas in developed countries where Internet connectivity is highest. To uncover atypical regions, it is necessary to normalize activity by the local computer population. This paper presents EMBER (Extreme Malicious Behavior viewER), an analysis and display of malicious activity at the city level. EMBER uses a metric called Standardized Incidence Rate (SIR) that is the number of hosts exhibiting malicious behavior per 100,000 available hosts. This metric relies on available data that (1) Maps IP addresses to geographic locations, (2) Provides current city populations, and (3) Provides computer usage penetration rates. Analysis of several months of suspicious source IP addresses from DShield identifies cities with extremely high and low malicious activity rates on a day-by-day basis. In general, cities in a few Eastern European countries have the highest SIRs whereas cities in Japan and South Korea have the lowest. Many of these results are consistent with news reports describing local cyber security policies. A simulation that models how malware spreads preferentially within cities to local IP addresses replicates the long-tailed distribution of city SIRs that was found in the data. This simulation result agrees with past analyses in suggesting that malware often preferentially spreads to local regions with already high levels of malicious activity."

The ability to correlate and visualize the dynamics and inter-relationships among various network components such as hosts, users, and applications is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach based on the hierarchical structure of similarity/difference visualization in the context of heterogeneous graphs. The concept of hierarchical visualization starts with the evolution of inter-graph states, adapts to the visualization of intra-graph clustering, and concludes with the visualization of similarity between individual nodes. Our visualization tool, ENAVis (Enterprise Network Activities Visualization), quantifies and presents these important changes and dynamics essential to network operators through a visually appealing and highly interactive manner. Through novel graph construction and transformation, such as network connectivity graphs, MDS graphs, bipartite graphs, and similarity graphs, we demonstrate how similarity/dynamics can be effectively visualized to provide insight with regards to network understanding."

By correlating and normalizing multiple software analysis tools' data, the overall vulnerability detection coverage of software is increased.

That is, each caller is presented with a graphical representation of the key and through verbal interaction (i.e., side-channel authentication) they describe what they see. If they agree, the key is authenticated and the secure media session continues. The strength of the approach lies in the vocal recognition of the callers, and their ability to confirm the image displayed by their system. The necessary degree of visual recognition is achieved by using basic shapes, color and count. People, regardless of language or age, can easily identifying these images. Our experience shows that they can communicate what they see with little effort and terminate the call when they differ. We believe that this approach reverses the current trend in security to divest users from the underlying cryptographic principles supporting secure systems by abstracting these principles to a comprehensible and visual form. This paper demonstrates that visualization and the human factor can play a pivotal role in establishing a secure communication channel. This short paper discusses how a key is visualized and provides some initial user feedback. We have named this approach the Short Authentication SymbolS VisuallY (SASSY.)"

A CMV visualization consisting of a node-link diagram, scatterplot, and time histogram is described that allows interactive analysis from different perspectives, as some network anomalies can only be identified through joint features in the provided spaces. Spectral analysis methods are integrated to provide visual cues that allow identification of malicious nodes. An adjacency-based method is developed to generate the time histogram, which allows users to select time ranges in which suspicious activity occurs. Data from Sybil attacks in simulated wireless networks is used as the test bed for the system. The results and discussions demonstrate that intrusion detection can be achieved with a few iterations of CMV exploration. Quantitative results are collected on the accuracy of our approach and comparisons are made to single domain exploration and other high-dimensional projection methods. We believe that this approach can be extended to anomaly detection in general networks, particularly to Internet networks and social networks."

Specifically, we take advantage of the observation that many Internet application protocols proscribe a very specific series of client/server interactions that are clearly visible in the sizes and timing of packets produced at the network layer and below. We show how so-called \"visual motifs\" built on these features can be used to assist a human operator to recognize application protocols in unidentified traffic. From a practical point of view, visual traffic classification can be used, for example, for anomaly detection to verify that all traffic to a web server on TCP port 80 does indeed exhibit the characteristic behavior patterns of HTTP, or for misuse detection to find unauthorized servers or to identify traffic generated by prohibited applications. We present our technique for building a classifier based on the notion of visual motifs and report on our experience using this technique to automatically classify on-the-wire behavioral patterns from network flow data collected from a campus network. Specifically, we analyze over 1 billion flows corresponding to over 5 million sessions on nearly 200 distinct ports and show that our approach achieves high recall and precision."

We present a system that combines multiple, complementary visualization techniques coupled with in-stream analytics, behavioral modeling of network actors, and a high-throughput processing platform called MeDICi. This system provides situational understanding of real-time network activity to help analysts take proactive response steps. We have developed these techniques using requirements gathered from the government users for which the tools are being developed.

However, this is a problem of scale since it is infeasible to manually inspect thousands of hosts without proper visual support for the tasks of gaining an overview, focusing and retrieving details on demand. In this paper we present a design study to enable visual support for monitoring large IP spaces. In particular, the presented system features 1) a scalable glyph representation in the style of a clock for giving an overview of the activity over time of thousands of hosts in the network, 2) subnet and port views for focusing the analysis to a particular subset of the data and 3) detailed pixel matrix visualizations for interpreting concrete traffic patterns.

TVi allows analysts to visualize data starting at a high level, providing information related to the entire network, and easily move all the way down to a very low level, providing detailed information about selected hosts, anomalies and attack paths. We designed TVi with scalability and extensibility in mind: its DBMS foundations make it scalable with virtually no limitations, and other state-of-the-art IDS, like Snort or Bro, can be easily integrated in our tool. We demonstrate with two case studies, a synthetic dataset (DARPA 1999) and a real one (University of Brescia, UniBS, 2009), how TVi can enhance a network administrator's ability to reveal hidden patterns in network traces and link their key information so as to easily reveal details that by merely observing Snort's output would go unnoticed.

This is a critical issue given the amount of network data under consideration, only a small portion of which can be examined at any one time. In this paper we present a visualization that provides context for network visualizations by providing a high-level view of network events. Our visualization not only provides a starting point for network visualization, but also reduces the cognitive burden of the analyst by providing a visual paradigm for both the filtering of network data and the selection of network data to drill into and visualize with alternative representations. We demonstrate, through the use of a case study, that our visualization can provide motivation for further investigation into anomalous network activity."

Complex attacks is used here to denote the type of attack which consists of a sequence of related events, namely a multistep, DDoS attack and alike. While there are numerous systems to visualize events that occur in the network, most of them are too complex to perceive, and require several visualization modes. This work presents a technique whereby the operator, using visualization alone, is able to display the full picture of events occurring in the network. The main feature of this method is the high recognition ratio of complex attacks as the sequence of constituent common events."

With IPv6 slowly being deployed around the world, network intruders are beginning to adapt their tools and techniques to work over IPv6 (vs. IPv4). Many tools for visualizing network activity, while useful for detecting large scale attacks and network behavior anomalies still only support IPv4. In this paper, we explore the current state of IPv6 support in some popular security visualization tools and identify the roadblocks preventing those tools from supporting the new protocol. We propose a filtering technique that helps reduce the occlusion of IPv6 sources on graphs. We also suggest using treemaps for visually representing the vast space of remote addresses in IPv6."

This paper describes a comparative evaluation of a visualization application and a traditional interface for analyzing network packet captures, that was conducted as part of the user-centered design process. Structured, well-defined tasks and exploratory, open-ended tasks were completed with both tools. Accuracy and efficiency were measured for the well-defined tasks, number of insights was measured for exploratory tasks and user perceptions were recorded for each tool. The results of this evaluation demonstrated that users performed significantly more accurately in the well-defined tasks, discovered a higher number of insights and demonstrated a clear preference for the visualization tool. The study presented here may be useful for future visualization for network security visualization evaluation designers. Some of the challenges and lessons learned are described."

Despite their significant size, complexity, and the possibility of interaction between entries, no visually sophisticated tools exist that explicitly capture and visualize problematic interactions between rules to aid in the comprehension and modification of configuration files. Our initial work on the direct visualization of firewall configurations showed the limitations of visualizing just the range of packets that can be accepted. To visually capture the interactions between rules, we introduce the concept of a created void. Created voids capture the information about destructive interactions between rules in a firewall ruleset, where an overlap between a deny rule prevents that packet from reaching an accept rule later in the ruleset. We present a lossless five-dimensional visualization of the convex solid decomposition of the set of acceptable packets from a firewall configuration, augmented with visual representations of created voids. This interactive visualization is embedded in a simple firewall ruleset editor, allowing the user to investigate the effect of changes in the ruleset."

        "abstract": "Passwords are a fundamental security vulnerability in many systems. Several researchers have investigated the tradeoff between password memorability versus resiliency to cracking and have looked at alternative systems such as graphical passwords and biometrics. To create stronger passwords, many systems enforce rules regarding the required length and types of characters passwords must contain. Another suggested approach is to use passphrases to combat dictionary attacks. One common trick used to remember passwords that conform to complex rules is to select a pattern of keys on the keyboard. While appearing random, the pattern is easy to remember. The purpose of this research was to investigate how often patterns are used, whether patterns could be classified into common categories, and whether those categories could be used to attack and defeat pattern-based passwords. Visualization techniques were used to collect data and assist in pattern categorization. The approach successfully identified two out of eleven passwords in a real-world password file that were not discovered with a traditional dictionary attack. This paper will present the approach used to collect and categorize patterns, and describe the resulting attack method that successfully identified passwords in a live system."

In this paper, we present design principles for file analysis which support meaningful investigation when there is little or no knowledge of the underlying file format, but are flexible enough to allow integration of additional semantic information, when available. We also present results from the implementation of a visual reverse engineering system based on our analysis. We validate the efficacy of both our analysis and our system with case studies depicting analysis use cases where a hex editor would be of limited value. Our results indicate that visual approaches help analysts rapidly identify files, analyze unfamiliar file structures, and gain insights that inform and complement the current suite of tools currently in use."

This paper presents GARNET (Graphical Attack graph and Reachability Network Evaluation Tool), an interactive visualization tool that facilitates attack graph analysis. It provides a simplified view of critical steps that can be taken by an attacker and of host-to-host network reachability that enables these exploits. It allows users to perform “what-if” experiments including adding new zero-day attacks, following recommendations to patch software vulnerabilities, and changing the attacker starting location to analyze external and internal attackers. Users can also compute and view metrics of assets captured versus attacker effort to compare the security of complex networks. For adversaries with three skill levels, it is possible to create graphs of assets captured versus attacker steps and the number of unique exploits required. GARNET is implemented as a Java application and is built on top of an existing C++ engine that performs reachability and attack graph computations. An initial round of user evaluations described in this paper led to many changes that significantly enhance usability."

These attack graphs, however, are often complex and difficult to comprehend fully, and a human user may find it problematic to reach appropriate configuration decisions. This paper presents methodologies that can 1) automatically identify portions of an attack graph that do not help a user to understand the core security problems and so can be trimmed, and 2) automatically group similar attack steps as virtual nodes in a model of the network topology, to immediately increase the understandability of the data. We believe both methods are important steps toward improving visualization of attack graphs to make them more useful in configuration management for large enterprise networks. We implemented our methods using one of the existing attack-graph toolkits. Initial experimentation shows that the proposed approaches can 1) significantly reduce the complexity of attack graphs by trimming a large portion of the graph that is not needed for a user to understand the security problem, and 2) significantly increase the accessibility and understandability of the data presented in the attack graph by clearly showing, within a generated visualization of the network topology, the number and type of potential attacks to which each host is exposed."

At the same time, a trend towards massive attacks against the network infrastructure is noticeable. Therefore, monitoring large networks has become an important field in practice and research. Through monitoring systems, attacks can be detected and analyzed to gain knowledge of how to better protect the network in the future. In the scope of this paper, we present a system, called NFlowVis, to analyze NetFlow data using a relational database system. NetFlow records are linked with alerts from an intrusion detection system to enable efficient exploration of suspicious activity within the monitored network. Within the system, the monitored network is mapped to a TreeMap visualization, the attackers are arranged at the borders and linked using splines parameterized with prefix information. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate how the tool can be used to judge the relevance of alerts, to reveal massive distributed attacks, and to analyze service usage within a network."

The complexity is measured in terms of visual integration, number of separable dimensions for each visual unit, the complexity of interpreting the visual attributes, and the efficiency of visual search. Visualization developers can use this method to quickly evaluate multiple design choices in the early stage of their design before any user study can be conducted. To demonstrate this method, we have conducted complexity analysis on two open source security visualization tools – TNV and RUMINT."

        "abstract": "NetBytes Host Viewer is an interactive visualization tool designed to show the historical network flow data per port of an individual host machine or subnet on a network over time, using a 3D impulse graph plot. Such visualizations allow network administrators to quickly and effectively diagnose infected or malfunctioning computers by viewing data transmission patterns for each port on the entity. NetBytes has a set of interactive features which help to deal with the problems associated with displaying a 3D graph on a 2D screen. First, NetBytes offers a “selector” mode which allows the user to highlight specific ports (or times) on the graph using a slider and snap buttons. From the selector, the user can launch a set of 2D graphs (Bytes vs. Time and Bytes vs. Ports) to acquire more detailed information about the host with less clutter. Lastly, the user is able to rotate the 3D graph in any direction to mitigate occlusion. The long term objectives of this work include the integration of the NetBytes Viewer with complementary visualizations of the overall network. This application will integrate with a larger network analysis tool and be utilized as a drill-down mechanism."

We present a new visualization of a computer network for security purposes by approaching the problem from a service-oriented perspective. This approach involves a node graph visualization where each node is represented as a compound glyph, which gives details about the network activity for the specific node based upon its service usage. Furthermore, we visualize temporal activity using time slicing techniques in the compound glyph to give more details about the network and allow interactive controls for an administrator to actively monitor a network in order to react to security events quickly. Our resulting visualizations of networks successfully identified and described denial of service (DoS) and compromised network attacks."

The article further introduces the analysis tasks we are currently tackling.

Another form of denying availability is to prevent communication through the use of traditional jamming techniques. At the United States Air Force Academy Center for Information Security, we have been working on a new algorithm, BBC, which is based on a new type of coding theory known as concurrent codes that is resistant to traditional jamming techniques. While the formal definition and proofs of concurrent codes can be daunting, the algorithm’s effectiveness can be easily conveyed and appreciated through visual demonstration. This paper briefly introduces concurrent codes and describes an interactive applet that visually demonstrates the algorithm’s effectiveness in a noisy environment."

Few visualization tools support creating, maintaining, and applying this knowledge of the threat landscape. Through a series of formative workshops with practicing security analysts, we have developed a visualization approach inspired by the human process of contextualization; this system, called NUANCE, creates evolving behavioral models of network actors at organizational and regional levels, continuously monitors external textual information sources for themes that indicate security threats, and automatically determines if behavior indicative of those threats is present on a network."

Even with simplification, current attack graph displays are complex and difficult to relate to the underlying physical networks. We have developed a new interactive tool intended to provide a simplified and more intuitive understanding of key weaknesses discovered by attack graph analysis. Separate treemaps are used to display host groups in each subnet and hosts within each treemap are grouped based on reachability, attacker privilege level, and prerequisites. Users position subnets themselves to reflect their own intuitive grasp of network topology. Users can also single-step the attack graph to successively add edges that cascade to show how attackers progress through a network and learn what vulnerabilities or trust relationships allow critical steps. Finally, an integrated reachability display demonstrates how filtering devices affect host-to-host network reachability and influence attacker actions. This display scales to networks with thousands of hosts and many subnets. Rapid interactivity has been achieved because of an efficient C++ computation engine (a program named NetSPA) that performs attack graph and reachability computations, while a Java application manages the display and user interface."

This paper presents a study of using associative memory learning techniques to directly compare network scans in order to create a classification which can be used by itself or in conjunction with existing visualization techniques to better characterize the sources of these scans. This produces an integrated system of visual and intelligent analysis which is applicable to real world data."

Scan detection algorithms used by the Snort and Bro intrusion detection systems are critiqued by comparing the visualised scans with alert output. Where human assessment disagrees with the alert output, explanations are sought by analysing the detection algorithms. The Snort and Bro algorithms are based on counting unique connection attempts to destination addresses and ports. For Snort, notable false positive and false negative cases result due to a grossly oversimplified method of counting unique destination addresses and ports."

We propose an effective approach to monitoring and detecting such attacks by integrating network security and visualization methods. The security component explores the time-varying network topology and its statistical and geometry information to detect the existence of Sybil attacks. The visualization component incorporates the detection results and provides an effective mechanism to illustrate abnormal topology patterns and locate fake identities. These two components are integrated into a practical system that takes advantage of both interactive visualization and intelligent security methods. Experimental studies are conducted to investigate the impacts of the network parameters such as node connectivity on the detection capability of the proposed mechanism."

Using regular means for displaying the data, such as text or tables, is often ineffective. Furthermore, displaying only raw data is not sufficient, because the security expert is still required to derive meaningful conclusions from large amounts of data. In addition, in many cases (e.g., for detecting a virus spreading in the network), an aggregated view of multiple network devices is more effective than a view of each individual device. In this paper we propose an intelligent interface used by a distributed architecture that was described in our previous work, specific to the tasks of knowledge-based interpretation, summarization, query, visualization and interactive exploration of large numbers of time-oriented data. In order to support the interpretation and computation process, we provide automated mechanisms that perform derivation of context-specific, interval-based abstract interpretations (also known as Temporal Abstractions) from raw time-stamped security data, by using a domain-specific knowledge-base (e.g., a period of 5 hours, during the night, of a high number of FTP connections within the context of No User Activity, which might indicate the existence of a Trojan in the computer). The proposed visualization tool includes several functionalities for querying, visualization and exploration of both raw and abstracted time-oriented security data regarding single and multiple network devices."

First, BGP updates are clustered to obtain BGP events that are more representative of an anomaly. These events are then correlated across all border routers to ascertain the extent of the anomaly. Furthermore, BGP Eye provides both the capability to analyze BGP anomalies from an Internet-Centric View through multiple vantage points as well as from a Home-Centric View of a particular Autonomous System. We present the capability for scalable and real-time root-cause analysis provided by BGP Eye through the analysis of two very different anomalies. First, we provide an Internet-Centric view from AS568 of the routing outages during the spread of the Slammer Worm on January 25th, 2003. Second, we provide a Home-Centric view from AS6458 of the routing outages caused by the inadvertent prefix hijacking by AS9121 on December 24th, 2004."

We also present an interactive grouping method to overcome the problem of the amount of data to display. Finally, two complementary visualizations based on that approach are described along with usage scenarios that illustrate their usefulness."

This proliferation of e-services has put large quantities of consumer private information in the hands of the service providers, who in many cases have mishandled the information, either intentionally or unintentionally, to the detriment of consumer privacy. As a result, government bodies have put in place privacy legislation that spells out a consumer's privacy rights and how consumer private information is to be handled. Providers are required to comply with such privacy legislation. This paper proposes visualization as a tool that can be used by security or privacy analysts to understand how private information flows within and between provider organizations, as a way of identifying vulnerabilities that can lead to non-compliance. A model of private information flow and a graphical notation for visualizing this flow are proposed. An application example of using the notation to identify privacy vulnerabilities is given."

IDtk was developed through a user-centered design process, in which we identified design guidelines to support ID users. ID analysts protect their networks by searching for evidence of attacks in ID system output, firewall and system logs, and other complex, textual data sources. Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of information visualization techniques offers a valuable addition to the toolkit of the ID analyst. Several visualization techniques for ID have been developed, but few usability or field studies have been completed to assess the needs of ID analysts and the usability and usefulness of these tools. We intended to fill this gap by applying a user-centered design process in the development and evaluation of IDtk, a 3D, glyph-based visualization tool that gives the user maximum flexibility in setting up how the visualization display represents ID data. The user can also customize whether the display is a simple, high-level overview to support monitoring, or a more complex 3D view allowing for viewing the data from multiple angles and thus supporting analysis and diagnosis. This flexibility was found crucial in our usability evaluation. In addition to describing the tool, we report the findings of our user evaluation and propose new guidelines for the design of information visualization tools for ID."

Often, important details are overlooked and it is difficult to get an overall picture of what is occurring in the network by manually traversing textual alarm logs. We have designed a novel visualization to address this problem by showing alarm activity within a network. Alarm data is presented in an overview where system administrators can get a general sense of network activity and easily detect anomalies. They then have the option of zooming and drilling down for details. The information is presented with local network IP (Internet Protocol) addresses plotted over multiple y-axes to represent the location of alarms. Time on the x-axis is used to show the pattern of the alarms and variations in color encode the severity and amount of alarms. Based on our system administrator requirements study, this graphical layout addresses what system administrators need to see, is faster and easier than analyzing text logs, and uses visualization techniques to effectively scale and display the data. With this design, we have built a tool that effectively uses operational alarm log data generated on the Georgia Tech campus network. The motivation and background of our design is presented along with examples that illustrate its usefulness."

In particular, many tools exist that detect network scans or visualize them at a high level, but not very many tools exist that are capable of categorizing and analyzing network scans. This paper presents a means of facilitating the process of characterization by using visualization and statistics techniques to analyze the patterns found in the timing of network scans through a method of continuous improvement in measures that serve to separate the components of interest in the characterization so the user can control separately for the effects of attack tool employed, performance characteristics of the attack platform, and the effects of network routing in the arrival patterns of hostile probes. The end result is a system that allows large numbers of network scans to be rapidly compared and subsequently identified."

Root polar coordinates overcome two important problems of normal polar coordinates: plot density distortion and severe occlusion near the origin. We discuss several approaches we took while investigating this problem and provide empirical data from experiments we conducted comparing root polar coordinates against both normal polar and Cartesian coordinates. In any application where a polar plot would be useful but distortion of the data must be avoided, or where it is important to avoid some markers from being occluded by others, root polar coordinates may be useful. Our approach provides: (1) a novel adaptation of polar coordinates that overcomes plotting distortion; (2) a means of plotting network data in near real-time without complex layout optimization; (3) an algorithm that reduces occlusion of plotted points while maintaining consistent placement; and (4) an empirical comparison of Cartesian vs. polar plots."

        "abstract": "Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for: 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies; 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns; 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow. IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the histographs (Pin Ren and Watson, 2005) technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis. We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed attacks."

In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network."

Both representations are based on the same interactive grid representation of the network space and are linked together as they provide complementary functionalities.The 3D representation provides an overview of the communications between several network zones and the 2D representation provides a detailed view of selected parts of the 3D one.

Using these systems, it is difficult to understand the source of attack, the diffusion of the attack, or the relation between the target and the source of the attack. This paper described a method for visualizing cyber threats by using 2-dimensional matrix representation of IP addresses. The advantages of this method are that: (1) the logical distance of IP addresses is represented intuitively; (2) Internet address space is visualized economically; (3) macroscopic information (Internet level) and microscopic information (local level) are visualized simultaneously. By using this visualization framework, propagation of the Welchia worm and the Sasser.D worm are visualized."

Unfortunately, many applications of visualization technology fall short of expectations because the technology is used inappropriately - the wrong tool applied in the wrong way. A study of visualization techniques as applied to one particularly demanding area, information assurance, leads to the conclusion that there is a proper and formal way to approach designing visualization techniques for maintaining situational awareness in complex domains. Visualization techniques should be specifically designed or selected to align with one of the three identified stages of situational awareness - perception, comprehension, or projection -and with one of five standard uses of visualization - monitoring, inspecting, exploring, forecasting, or communicating. Greater value can be realized by selecting the right visualization technique to focus on each operational task, rather than searching for a single all-encompassing solution to fit every need. Examples of how visualizations can be used to support specific tasks of IA analysis are presented, with examples based on a review of available literature, a formal cognitive task analysis performed by the authors, and lessons learned from direct experience with developing IA visualizations and training analysts in their use."

Moreover, the techniques we describe can be applied not only separately, but can also be combined into coordinated attack graph views. We apply improved visual clustering to previously described network protection domains (attack graph cliques), which reduces graph complexity and makes the overall attack flow easier to understand. We also visualize the attack graph adjacency matrix, which shows patterns of network attack while avoiding the clutter usually associated with drawing large graphs. We show how the attack graph adjacency matrix concisely conveys the impact of network configuration changes on attack graphs. We also describe a novel attack graph filtering technique based on the interactive navigation of a hierarchy of attack graph constraints. Overall, our techniques scale quadratically with the number of machines in the attack graph."

One problem with current implementations, however, is the sheer number of alerts they can generate, many of which tend to be false alarms. This drawback makes effective use of such systems a challenging task. In this paper we explore three-dimensional approaches to visualizing network intrusion detection system alerts and aggregated network statistics in order to provide the system administrator with a better picture of the events occurring on his or her network. While some research has been done using two-dimensional concepts, 3D approaches have not received much attention with regard to detecting network intrusions. Evaluation of our visualizations using the 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set demonstrates the potential benefit of utilizing the third dimension. We show how a number of attack types in the data set generate visual evidence of abnormal activity that a security administrator might use as motivation for further investigation."

We show how these visualizations can be used to assist a human operator to recognize application protocols in unidentified traffic and to verify the results of an automated classifier via visual inspection. In particular, our preliminary results show that we can visually scan almost 45,000 connections in less than one hour and correctly identify known application behaviors. Moreover, using visualizations together with an automated comparison technique based on Dynamic Time Warping of the motifs, we can rapidly develop accurate recognizers for new or previously unknown applications."

Central to the design is a parallel axes view which displays NetFlow records as links between two machines or domains while employing a variety of visual cues to assist the user. We describe several filtering options that can be employed to hide uninteresting or innocuous traffic such that the user can focus his or her attention on the more unusual network flows. This design is implemented in the form of VisFlowConnect, a prototype application which we used to study the effectiveness of our visualization approach. Using VisFlowConnect, we were able to discover a variety of interesting network traffic patterns. Some of these were harmless, normal behavior, but some were malicious attacks against machines on the network."

The techniques used are entirely passive in nature and virtually undetectable by the attackers. While much work has been done on active and passive operating systems detection, little has been done on fingerprinting the specific tools used by attackers. This research explores the application of several visualization techniques and their usefulness toward identification of attack tools, without the typical automated intrusion detection system's signatures and statistical anomalies. These visualizations were tested using a wide range of popular network security tools and the results show that in many cases, the specific tool can be identified and provides intuition that many classes of zero-day attacks can be rapidly detected and analyzed using similar techniques."

While the visualization technique alone has powerful application for both directed and undirected exploration of many classes of binary objects, we chose to study network packets. To increase effectiveness, we strengthened the visualization technique with novel, domain-specific semantic zooming, interactive encoding and dynamic querying capabilities. We present results and lessons learned from implementing these techniques and from studying both malicious and non-malicious network packets. Our results indicate that the information visualization system we present is an efficient and effective way to compare large numbers of network packets, visually examine their payloads and navigate to areas of interest within large network datasets."

We present how virus codes affect the whole program projection. Without each virus signature, we present how the virus pattern in Windows executable files tells us their family.

These tools often provide no overview to help users grasp the big-picture. Our interviews with administrators have revealed that they need visualization tools; thus, we present VISUAL (Visual Information Security Utility for Administration Live), a network security visualization tool that allows users to see communication patterns between their home (or internal) networks and external hosts. VISUAL is part of our Network Eye security visualization architecture, also described in this paper. We have designed and tested a new computer security visualization that gives a quick overview of current and recent communication patterns in the monitored network to the users. Many tools can detect and show fan-out and fan-in, but VISUAL shows network events graphically, in context. Visualization helps users comprehend the intensity of network events more intuitively than text-based tools can. VISUAL provides insight for networks with up to 2,500 home hosts and 10,000 external hosts, shows the relative activity of hosts, displays them in a constant relative position, and reveals the ports and protocols used."

        "abstract": "Most of the prevalent anomaly detection systems use some training data to build models. These models are then utilized to capture any deviations resulting from possible intrusions. The efficacy of such systems is highly dependent upon a training data set free of attacks. \"Clean\" or labeled training data is hard to obtain. This paper addresses the very practical issue of refinement of unlabeled data to obtain a clean data set which can then train an online anomaly detection system. Our system, called MORPHEUS, represents a system call sequence using the spatial positions of motifs (subsequences) within the sequence. We also introduce a novel representation called sequence space to denote all sequences with respect to a reference sequence. Experiments on well known data sets indicate that our sequence space can be effectively used to purge anomalies from unlabeled sequences. Although an unsupervised anomaly detection system in itself, our technique is used for data purification. A \"clean\" training set thus obtained improves the performance of existing online host-based anomaly detection systems by increasing the number of attack detections."

        "year": "2004",
        "abstract": "We describe a framework for managing network attack graph complexity through interactive visualization, which includes hierarchical aggregation of graph elements. Aggregation collapses non-overlapping subgraphs of the attack graph to single graph vertices, providing compression of attack graph complexity. Our aggregation is recursive (nested), according to a predefined aggregation hierarchy. This hierarchy establishes rules at each level of aggregation, with the rules being based on either common attribute values of attack graph elements or attack graph connectedness. The higher levels of the aggregation hierarchy correspond to higher levels of abstraction, providing progressively summarized visual overviews of the attack graph. We describe rich visual representations that capture relationships among our semantically-relevant attack graph abstractions, and our views support mixtures of elements at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. While it would be possible to allow arbitrary nested aggregation of graph elements, it is better to constrain aggregation according to the semantics of the network attack problem, i.e., according to our aggregation hierarchy. The aggregation hierarchy also makes efficient automatic aggregation possible. We introduce the novel abstraction of protection domain as a level of the aggregation hierarchy, which corresponds to a fully-connected subgraph (clique) of the attack graph. We avoid expensive detection of attack graph cliques through knowledge of the network configuration, i.e. protection domains are predefined. While significant work has been done in automatically generating attack graphs, this is the first treatment of the management of attack graph complexity for interactive visualization. Overall, computation in our framework has worst-case quadratic complexity, but in practice complexity is greatly reduced because users generally interact with (often negligible) subsets of the attack graph. We apply our framework to a real network, using a software system we have developed for generating and visualizing network attack graphs."

Some of these attacks have exploited vulnerabilities for which advisories had been issued and for which patches and detection signatures were available. It is increasingly apparent, however, that such prevention and detection mechanisms are inadequate, and that the attacker's time to exploit is shrinking relative to the defender's ability to learn of a new attack and patch systems or update intrusion detection signatures. We introduce visual, scalable techniques to detect phenomena such as distributed denial-of-service attacks and worms. It is hoped that these new approaches will enable detection of such events at an early stage and enable local response actions even before the publication of advisories about a new vulnerability and the availability of patches."

        "abstract": "Large complex networks have become an inseparable part of modern society. However, very little has been done to develop tools to manage and ensure the security of such networks. Network operators continue to slave over endless daily logs and alerts in a struggle to keep networks operational. Perhaps the most formidable enemy of network operations today is the volume of management data that must be perused. Expensive commercial products attempt to visualize data but with limited utility, as witnessed by the prevailing use of command-line interfaces and homegrown scripts. In addition to data collection tools, operators need to immediately observe and debug the effects of their actions; yet that information is buried deep in the data that pours daily from monitoring equipment. Thus, they need better ways to abstract network events and better, more informative ways to render them. In this work we first propose a new approach for abstracting network information, namely spectral representation. Second, we introduce immersive spatial audio representations of network events. Third, we introduce 3D interactive auto-stereoscopic (AS) displays for visual representations. We integrate the three techniques as follows. We use spectral techniques to extract complex events buried inside voluminous network traces and logs. Then, we create a desktop interactive immersive auto-stereoscopic 3D environment that is seamlessly integrated with multi-channel spatially rendered audio to render such events in a far more human-friendly fashion."

To counteract these drawbacks an interactive detection system based on simple Bayesian statistics combined with a visualisation component is proposed, in the hope that this lets the operator better understand how exactly the intrusion detection system is operating. The resulting system is applied to the log of a webserver. The combination proved to be effective. The Bayesian classifier was reasonably effective in learning to differentiate between benign and malicious accesses, and the visualisation component enabled the operator to discern when the intrusion detection system was correct in its output and when it was not, and to take corrective action, re-training the system interactively, until the desired level of performance was reached."

        "abstract": "The massive volume of intrusion detection system (IDS) alarms generated on large networks, and the resulting need for labor-intensive security analysis of the text-based IDS alarm logs, has recently brought into question the cost-effectiveness of IDSs. In particular, when host-based IDSs are used to monitor an organization's internal networks, the majority of the resulting alarms represent legitimate, automated system administration. Because of the absence of ground truth about known attacks, we propose an unsupervised, anomaly-based method for automatically distinguishing alarms that are potentially generated by malicious insider attacks, from the repetitive and temporally structured legitimate system-administration alarms. The majority of previous work in this area has used heuristic and statistical filtering techniques to discard a relatively large proportion of alarms in the final presentation to the security analyst, which is a potentially dangerous practice. Instead, we demonstrate the use of a typicality measure to visualize the apparent risk associated with alarms, while retaining information about the temporal context of the entire alarm stream for the analyst to view. The relevance of the statistical method is examined by comparing the results to a set of analyst-curated alarms from an operational environment."

Second, while cluster state and performance data have been visually monitored in several systems, there are currently no cluster monitors that visualize cluster security events. We have developed a framework for effective visualization of a high performance cluster security which we describe in this paper. We present GUI screenshots from a security visualization tool based on this framework and discuss our experience using this tool on high performance clusters at NCSA."

Inappropriate customization causes the increase of false negatives as well as false positives. In this paper, we propose a visualization system of a NIDS log, named SnortView, which supports administrators in analyzing NIDS alerts much faster and much more easily. Instead of customizing the signature DB, we propose to utilize visualization to recognize not only each alert but also false detections. The system is based on a 2-D time diagram and alerts are shown as icons with different styles and colors. In addition, the system introduces some visualization techniques such as overlayed statistical information, source-destination matrix, and so on.
